# pyFHE
This is repository for python implementation of TFHE. This depends massively on numpy.

# About This Branch
anqounizedCircuitBootstrapping is optimized for numpy usage, so some codes are not easy to read. Pure Python branch is more easy to read but slow and lack a support of Circuit Bootstrapping.

CAUTTION: Currently, decrypiton algorithms can decrypt only binary message, so some of outputs are invalid.
